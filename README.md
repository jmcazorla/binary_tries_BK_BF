#Intersectable sets with BK and BF based on compressed trie
--------
## Building the code
The code was tested in ubuntu 20.04 and gcc 9.3.0 version. The code has dependencies on the [**sdsl**](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) library.

To build the code in linux sistems, run the following commands:

    mkdir build
    make

Now the all executables are in **build** folder.

## Input data format
Our implementation only need the collection of docID's (posting lists) following format of [**dsi2**](https://github.com/ot/ds2i) and [**pisa**](https://github.com/pisa-engine/pisa) projects, the posting lists are written as 32-bit little-endian unsigned integers. The files containing the collections must start with a singleton binary sequence, where it's only integer is the number of documents of collection or universe (1 u). It is then followed by one binary sequence for each posting list. 

## How to compress collection
For compress a collection need to use build.out exec as following.

    ./build.out [collection_file_name] [--rank rank_type] [block_size] [--runs r] [--low_part_size l] [--out o] [--min_size min] [--max_size max]
Where:
* --rank rank_type (required): its the type of rank data structure, the possible values are: v, v5, il.
* block_size: only need to add block_size if you use rank il.
* --runs r (required): possible values t o f, indicating if we compress or not the runs in the tries.
* --out o (optional): name of output file to save the tries, if not specified only return the space metrics of collection.
* --min_size min (optional): filter lists of length less than a min.
* --max_size max (optional): filter lists of length greater than a max.

## Intersection
For test the intersection of the tries, only need the file containing the collection compressed and a file with lists of sets involved in a query. The each line of queries file contain the id's of sets involved in a intersection to compute, every id it's separated by only one space. Every id of set correspond position of set in the complete collection.

An example to calculate the intersection in a collection using a query file is the following:

    ./queries.out [collection_file_name] [queries_file_name] [--type_intersection type]
    
Where:
* --type_intersection type (required): is the base intersection algorithm, possible values ​​are bk(Barbay and Kenyon) or bf(Brute Force).
